# EzyElders: Financial Projections

## Executive Summary

This financial projection presents a detailed forecast of EzyElders' performance over its first three years of operation. Starting with an initial investment of ₹1,00,00,000, the business is projected to reach profitability in Year 2, with steadily improving margins thereafter. The primary revenue driver will be membership subscriptions, supplemented by event and tour fees, with the introduction of care services in Year 2 providing an additional revenue stream.

The projections indicate a financially viable business model with strong growth potential. While Year 1 shows a planned investment period with a small loss, Years 2 and 3 demonstrate increasing profitability as operational efficiencies improve and membership numbers grow.
